# European-Bank-Churn-Analysis
Focused on identifying churn drivers through customer demographics and behavioral data, with actionable business insights for retention strategies.
Customer churn is a major challenge in the banking industry, directly impacting revenue and long-term growth.
This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data using SQL (MySQL) to identify key churn drivers, high-risk customer segments, and actionable insights that can help improve customer retention.

The analysis follows a business-driven storytelling approach, not just query outputs.

Business Objective:
The primary goals of this project are:
Identify which customer segments are more likely to churn
Understand how demographics and customer behavior influence churn
Provide data-backed recommendations to reduce customer attrition

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains customer-level banking information, including:
Demographics (Age, Gender, Geography)
Financial attributes (Credit Score, Balance, Estimated Salary)
Account behavior (Tenure, Number of Products, Active Member Status, Credit Card ownership)
Churn indicator (Exited)
The raw data was initially explored in Excel and then imported into MySQL for structured analysis.

Tools & Technologies:
SQL (MySQL)
Excel (initial data exploration)
Git & GitHub (version control)
PowerPoint (storytelling & presentation)

Analysis Approach:
The project follows a structured analytical workflow:
Data understanding and validation (null checks, duplicates)
Table creation and schema design in MySQL
Customer segmentation based on demographics and behavior
Churn vs non-churn comparative analysis
Business interpretation of insights

Key Analysis Areas:
Overall churn rate analysis
Churn by age groups and tenure
Geography-wise churn comparison
Credit score and balance impact on churn
Active vs inactive customer behavior
Product holding patterns and churn relationship

Key Insights:
Certain customer age groups exhibit significantly higher churn rates
Inactive customers show a higher likelihood of churning, even with higher balances
Churn behavior varies across geographic regions
Early-tenure customers are more vulnerable to churn

Business Recommendations:
Implement targeted retention strategies for high-risk customer segments
Improve engagement programs for inactive but high-value customers
Strengthen onboarding experience for new customers
Design region-specific retention campaigns
